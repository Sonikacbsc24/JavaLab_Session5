Java program on modular banking software using packages, access protection, interfaces, and polymorphism with custom edu.bank and Loan implementation.

Java program demonstrating the use of packages and interfaces in a modular banking system.

A custom package edu.bank is created with a Loan interface, which is implemented by HomeLoan and CarLoan classes.

This program highlights access protection, interface implementation, and polymorphism to build flexible banking software.

The main method creates and uses different loan objects, showing how interfaces enable code reuse and modularity.

Good for understanding Java packages, interfaces, and real-world application structure.

## Program Output:

Home Loan Interest Rate: 7.5

Car Loan Interest Rate: 9.0
